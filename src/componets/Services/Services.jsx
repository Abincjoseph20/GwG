        <p>
         Bridal makeup is entirely up to the bride. What could be great for one bride is awful for the next. 
         Are you a bride to be that has no clue what kind of makeup to have on your big day? Many brides, often 
         feel overwhelmed by all the planning and excitement going on around them, that they completely forget 
         about deciding on their hair and makeup. This decision tends to come nearer the wedding day,
          but if youâ€™re one of these brides 
         that are super organised and want to plan everything ahead of schedule, you have come to the right place!
